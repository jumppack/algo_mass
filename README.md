# Algorithm Learning Journey

This repository is dedicated to my personal algorithm learning journey. I will be tracking my progress from easy to difficult problems, covering various algorithm topics and data structures.

## Structure

For each algorithm topic, the structure is as follows:

- `[Algorithm_Name]/knowledge/`: Concepts and logic explanations.
- `[Algorithm_Name]/resource/`: Links and reference materials.
- `[Algorithm_Name]/practice/`: Code implementations in different languages.

## Topics

### Prefix Suffix Algorithms
- [Knowledge](./prefix_suffix_algorithms/knowledge/concepts.md)
- Practice: [Python](./prefix_suffix_algorithms/practice/solution.py) | [JavaScript](./prefix_suffix_algorithms/practice/solution.js)

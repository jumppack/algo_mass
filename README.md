# Algorithm Learning Journey

This repository is dedicated to my personal algorithm learning journey. I will be tracking my progress from easy to difficult problems, covering various algorithm topics and data structures.

## Structure

For each algorithm topic, the structure is as follows:

- `[Algorithm_Name]/knowledge/`: Concepts and logic explanations (tiered levels).
- `[Algorithm_Name]/resource/`: Links and reference materials.
- `[Algorithm_Name]/practice/`: Code implementations in different languages.

## Topics

### Prefix Suffix Algorithms
- **Knowledge**:
    - [Level 1: ELI5 (The Magic Notebook)](./prefix_suffix_algorithms/knowledge/level1_eli5.md)
    - [Level 2: Intermediate (Standard)](./prefix_suffix_algorithms/knowledge/level2_intermediate.md)
    - [Level 3: Expert (Deep Dive)](./prefix_suffix_algorithms/knowledge/level3_expert.md)
- **Practice**:
    - Find Pivot Index: [Python](./prefix_suffix_algorithms/practice/find_pivot_index.py) | [JavaScript](./prefix_suffix_algorithms/practice/find_pivot_index.js)

All the files in the practise folder will be either JS files or python files
The details in the practise files must be very elaborative. I am trying to learn algorithms here but I also want to dive deeper into the concept.
A folder must be created for any new algorithm we shall be discussing. If some algorithms are based on complex subjects then you can go ahead and create a new folder for each of those algorithms and then again create the structure as in "prefix suffix sum" which includes folders like knowldedge, practice, resources and any other subfolder if required.
